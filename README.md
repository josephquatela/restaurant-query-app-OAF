#Restaurant Query App
-------------------------
## Goal
The goal of this project, done as part of an internship with Open Avenues Foundation, was to create a fully custom query search tool to filter and view large amount of restaurant data. Through this project I became very comfortable with the ReactJS framework and practiced structuring more complicated projects.
## Features
Selection by (individually or combinationally):
- Restaurant IDs
- Date Ranges
- Time Ranges
- Various Metric Criteria

Results sorted by a restaurant card with a summary given for each, expandable to show all data.

## Hosted
### Data only available through dates in October 2021!
